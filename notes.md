# Notes 
"Expression Problem" - the fact that neither OO or functional languages can easily handle adding _both_ functions and types 


Left off at 6.4 challenge 2
	- Wrote the ternary operator bit 
		- Need to add lexing support for ? and : 
	- Could refactor the precedence parsing methods to take a delegate 


# Look Up 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpreter_pattern

Post-order traversal 
	Each node evaluates its children before doing its own work


# Left off 
Just got to 8.2 
	- Can run statements 
	- Need to fix all broken tests 


# Niceties 
- Implement memory by pressing up - and replaying and editing a previous line in the REPL
